note: This project is still underway and I'm trying to optimize my models to make the best predictions possible. 

# How was the data aquaired? (including any sampling that was performed):

Data was aquired from the Tanzania Ministry of Water and the Taarifa Platform. The Taarifa Plateform is an open source API 
designed to use citizen feedback on local problems. 

# How the data was transformed and cleaned:

I used PandasProfiling to explore all of the columns in the data. The data had a few columns with a large amount of missing 
values. I chose to immediately drop those columns, due to the high volume of missing values. Imputing data or filling 
missing values would've changed the data too much. It was better to just drop them. Looking further into the data, there was 
also a decent amount of columns that were very similiar to one another. I examined these columns using value counts. If the 
columns were two similar, I chose to keep whichever one I thought was better and drop the other. I also group the contruction
years by decade since there were unique values for every year from 1960-2013. This would help later on when I needed to make 
dummy variables for my classification models. Luckily from there the data was cleaned up and I was comfotable to start running 
some models. 

# Outcome Variable:

My outcome variable is the status and functionallity of all of the ground water pumps found in Tanzania. My goal is to predict 
the which of the thousands of water pumps in Tanzania are functional, need repair or are completely non-functional. If my 
models are accurate, this could help save the Tanzanian government a lot of time and money.

# Models

SO far I have run three models on the data. I have run a K-Nearest Neighbors model, a Random Forest with balanced classes and 
a Random Forest with a gridsearch. My scores so far have been:
KNN = 0.66
Random Forest with Balanced Classes = 0.786
Random Forest with Gridsearch = -.807




As noted above I am still trying to optimize these models and make these numbers beter. I am also going to run a logisitic
regression and a gradient boosting classifier. Hopefully these will create better predictions.
